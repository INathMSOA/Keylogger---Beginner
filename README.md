# Keylogger---Beginner
A keylogger project designed to demonstrate how keystroke logging works for research and awareness.

# 🧠 Keylogger — Beginner Project (Educational Use Only)

This project is a **Python-based typing tracker** built for **educational and research purposes**.  
It demonstrates how keyboard event listeners work in Python using the [`pynput`](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) library, and how to **collect and sanitize keystroke data** safely for analysis — without storing any sensitive information.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> This project is strictly for learning and demonstration.  
> It should **never** be used to capture personal, private, or unauthorized input.  
> All data logging is anonymized and sanitized before storage.
