# Keylogger---Beginner
A keylogger project designed to demonstrate how keystroke logging works for research and awareness.

⌨️ Keylogger (Beginner Project)

A beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates how keyboard event listeners work — safely and ethically — using the `pynput` library.  

🧠 Description

This educational project helps you understand how **keyboard input tracking** works in Python.  
It simulates a basic keylogging mechanism and includes a **sanitization script** to remove sensitive data before saving or sharing logs.

It is designed **for learning purposes only** — not for real-world data capture.

It includes:
- ✅ Safe, local-only keystroke recording  
- ✅ A sanitizer that anonymizes recorded data  
- ✅ Clean, beginner-friendly Python code  

⚙️ Features

- ⌨️ Tracks key press events in real-time  
- 🧾 Logs data to a local text file for demonstration  
- 🧼 Sanitizes logs into safe, shareable CSV samples  
- 📁 Organized project structure and `.gitignore`  
- 🔒 Built with privacy and ethics in mind
